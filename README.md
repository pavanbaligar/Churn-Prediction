# Churn-Prediction
The Churn Prediction Challenge aims to create a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. Churn refers to when customers stop using a company's services. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve long-term success.

Objective
The goal of this project is to build an effective prediction model that accurately classifies whether a customer is likely to churn. The model is developed using historical customer data and evaluates customer behavior based on key features.
